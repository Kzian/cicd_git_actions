## 🛠️ GitHub Actions CI/CD

* Workflow file located at `.github/workflows/`
* Automatically runs tests and deploys to Heroku on push to the `main` branch
* Example workflow steps:

  * Install dependencies
  * Run tests
  * Deploy to Heroku

---

## 📋 Procfile

Heroku uses the **Procfile** to start the app:

```
web: node index.js
```

---

## 📝 Notes

* Ensure your `index.js` listens on the Heroku-assigned port:

```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`));
```

* You can view live logs for troubleshooting:

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```
